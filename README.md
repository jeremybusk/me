Cloud Computing:
  - I have and can use Cloud provider platforms like Azure, AWS, Digital Ocean but prefer just to use DISK and IP space if possible for cost savings, scaling and portability. Starting is fine but trying to scale really big you will lose margins.
Front-End Dev: (I use this stuff when needed)
  - JavaScript
  - CSS
  - https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive but I have had some exposure to AngularJS, ReactJS
  - https://mdbootstrap.com/
  - https://getbootstrap.com/
  - https://www.highcharts.com/  (Yes I have used D3 and C3.js but it sucked in comparison to highcharts.
Architecture:
  - I have been designing IaaS, PaaS and SaaS projects since college. It's not a mystery to me. I know and like all levels on the OSI model. I've seen the good, bad and the ugly. I think this knowledge is invaluable when designing new projects especially in todays atmosphere where many people only know a Cloud Computing Platform. I know the better ways to go about building Information Systems. I am able to make them simpler than most others can make them. I love the quote "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." -- E. F. Schumacher - I try and design complex things as simple as possible because they will get complex enough in their evolution.
More Traits:
- Very High Creative Intelligence
- Very focused, result driven and high work output. - No, I'm not a gamer and don't watch more YouTube than I actually work. My reward in my brain is actually creating functional information systems that do real things.
- Great communicator and leader - I might talk nerd but I'm not limited to it.



# More History
```
Focus: I like to model and build cost effective, stable, secure, performant, manageable and scalable information systems that promote and do beneficial stuff in the world. I prefer to use open source or open projects whenever possible. I donate money to opensource projects. I like the freedom, scale and protection it provides. I’ve spent a lot of time doing this. However, I always try to use proven methods in that space if they will get the job done instead of inventing my own less effective way. I like to always think BIG even when I start something small. I am able to learn any new technologies easily. I like to evolve, build and innovate to make things better than they currently are. I have a deep security background so when I build I tend to build with security in mind.

As you will see, I’m trying to cover a lot of ground here but I like creating creative information solutions around Linux & other open source tools. I don’t have an aversion to commercial software when needed but like the flexibility of open source. After working with a lot of languages I’m trying to push most of my code into PostgreSQL and use supporting apps & langs to support it where needed. I spent a lot of the last two years doing continuous integration & continuous deployment in a heavy Debian/Ubuntu environment. I designed, implemented & managed the infrastructure in our collocation, touching all layers of the OSI Model. I also did some full stack development utilizing http(s) reverse proxy (NGINX & some LUA) in order to do customized control on some JSON-RPC services. I usually research, architect and then implement solutions. I love brainstorming and having everyone’s ideas challenged in order to get the better solution. I like getting stuff done and have a long track record of doing just that without a project manager pushing me. I like to see the fruits of my labour and not a fan of vaporware.

I am able to learn most anything pretty quickly. I do not believe in technology lockin’ just because that is all I understand at the time and usually do comparatives when starting new projects to get the best of breed. My breadth and depth in data systems allow for this.

I believe every problem has a solution you just need to keep applying the hammer of effort with intelligence until accomplished.



Summary of Qualifications

Excellent at using programmatic scripting to perform tasks and try to apply the DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle as much as possible by preferring agile automation over error prone human repetition. 
Used numerous cli based operating systems and applications to do things. I prefer the command line. Yes, I use VIM. Yes, I use spaces.
Almost 20 years spending most of my time researching in a web browser and doing work in a terminal.
Ethics and good values are important to me. It is important for the products I create to have positive value to those who use and are used by them. A lot of tech has gotten really sketchy of late. I prefer to not be part of that. ISC2 ethics is a good starting point.  https://www.isc2.org/Ethics.

Nov 2017 - August 2019 
Still manage a full rack for them as needed
Pyrofex Corporation - Utah - https://pyrofex.io/
Site Reliability Engineer

Played role of systems/network engineer and a little software full stack development to support hosted applications. Built and managed rack infrastructure from ground up. We had a couple racks with some fun hardware to build fairly large build/test systems.
Agile software environment with about 5 devs using Gitlab Issues.
Heavy use of Gitlab & Gitlab CI/CD. Worked a lot with git over the last year and a half. Became proficient with CI/CD and complex array of runner setups.  Used KVM+QEMU VM with virsh, Virtualbox, Docker/LXD Containers. I used VIrtualbox as well as virsh. I even did some terraform using https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt. Included cloud-init as well. Didn’t get around to using Kubernetes much beyond a day of playing with MicroK8s as they wanted a project to deploy it as a VM image(wasn’t my call). Got back and did some classic Cisco IOS switch configuration. Did CI/CD automation with nftables (netfilter iptables replacement).
Used Prometheus & Grafana for metrics as well as traditional Zabbix.
Built automated web repo where packages would deploy to and customers could download packages.
Built a simple customer portal using Python Flask ecosystem & PostgreSQL. Connected with LXD for hosted containers with automated proxy port mapping and ssh key updates for access. Portal authentication Included Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using one time password. I prefer to use PostgreSQL with Postgrest or Postgraphile but devs were more used to traditional setup. We used portal and NGINX to control http methods/requests to JSON-RPC interfaces on bitcoin and ethereum nodes.

Nov 2017 - September 2018
ConsultNet - Utah - https://consultnet.com/
Site Reliability Engineer

https://github.com/rchain/rchain. Github & Travis-CI/Gitlab for Scala project. Agile development using JIRA. Did DevOps by myself, eventually getting two more, for a team of about 20-30 internal devs on an international open source blockchain project. It was incredibly fun to work with people from all over the world. U.S., Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia. We even had a guy from Belarus. Was lucky to get back to Europe at our Berlin conference. Lot’s of learning here as I really had not worked with git much beyond simple master commits that I was used to doing before at my previous job. CI/CD in the connected fashion was new to. especially in a complex environment like this where most work is done through remote communications. Throwing Scala/FP just made it more complex. The project used Github & Travis-CI with some CI done in parallel using CI via gitlab.com. Created and managed runners using Docker CE, and Virtualbox. Worked with Prometheus & Zabbix for metric collection & monitoring. Lots of little scripts. Did releases, signing and all that other fun stuff.
The DevOps scripts were primarily in BASH and Python. Used Docker, LXD, KVM. I worked quite a bit with pylxd & docker-py libraries as well as just interfacing with apis from the shell. Used saltstack for mass management. Worked with containers in AWS, Digital Ocean but the core was in a datacenter rack running Proxmox VE Cluster that then ran Virtualbox, Docker CE, LXD, KVM.

2015 - 2017
Veracity Networks - Utah - https://www.veracitynetworks.com/
Software Engineer/Full Stack Developer


Built external trouble ticketing portal with external user controls(for security and stability issues) that hooked into the existing ticketing database using PHP, Python, HTML5, JQuery DataTables https://editor.datatables.net/, MDBootstrap https://mdbootstrap.com/, and postgresql. As part of this, rewrote notifications for all ticketing using notify functions within PostgreSQL and Python to actually listen and dispatch notifications as needed.
Built DNS driven web-filtering solution for large college housing projects using PowerDNS Recursors, LUA and Redis for fast blocking of millions of domains. Basically like Cisco OpenDNS Security 
Designed from the ground up and created management portal using PostgreSQL, PostgREST, OpenResty(NGINX+LUA+Redis), Python, Bootstrap3, JQuery, HTML5, Ractivejs(similar to Vue.js. Utilized Redis with OpenResty for a fast session store and network front door control for application access, thus enhancing security.
Used Highcharts https://www.highcharts.com/ (preferred) as well as C3.js (D3.js based) to do data visualization. 
Built smaller micro apps using Python, Python Flask or Python Pyramid that would restfully do different things such as provision email, check and auto reply for email, or export reports in Excel after manipulation using Python Pandas,
Helped maintain code in our existing custom CRM that heavily uses Python Pyramid and SQLAlchemy with Postgres backend.
Worked with containerization technologies, like Docker and LXD, for development environments.
Limited work with AWS, Azure, GCE, Digital Ocean. I’ve usually always built my own infrastructure in the past as cloud costs ran really high and we wanted customized control. However, cloud offerings do have many benefits and I am happy to work with them if the project calls for it. The tech & structure is still the same whether on premises or hosted on a providers IaaS platform. My issue with cloud is it is still too expensive for larger applications.
